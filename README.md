# Race Control TV

> I'm not actively maintaining this release. I created this fork to fix the broken login in the 1.2.0 version.
Massive thanks and credit to [Groggy](https://github.com/Groggy), for creating this app in the first place!

Android TV application to watch content from [F1 TV](https://f1tv.formula1.com).

At this time, only live or replay content from the current season is available (F1, F2, F3, ...).
Onboard channels when available are supported, as well as technical channels like the tracker channel.

Multiple channels playback is not supported. Audio selection (language or no commentary) is supported.

Application is not translated and only available in english.

## Disclaimer

I have created this app because the official [F1 TV app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.formulaone.production)
does not officially support Android TV and even after sideloading it, it's not usable with a remote.
The official website is also not easily usable with a remote. If in the future an official application
would be available, I will happilly abandonned this one.

This application has been tested on a up-to-date Nvidia Shield TV 2017 version.

For you Belgian users: I can confirm this application works great on the Proximus V7 Android TV Decoder, after sideloading it.

This will allways be a free and open source app and will probably never be on Google Play.

Do what you want with it : use it or modify it.
